# BlindSqlInj
This repo is about a tool I had the opportunity to develop when I was pentesting a website.

In this repo you can find 2 scripts:  
1- script.py  
2- script_neat.py  

In the first file, you can see all possible codes (I included multiple possibilities) to extract database info, tables, columns and values by exploiting a Blind SQL Injection vulnerability.

The second file is just a neat and cleaner version of the first file. It allows you to see the simplicity of the code because the first contains a lot of comments and lines of code for debugging purposes. Yes, with these lines you can easily debug the code in case of an error.
